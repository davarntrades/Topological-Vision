## Abstract

This hypothesis proposes a unifying computational framework for perception in **biological**, **artificial**, and **distributed** intelligent systems. Perception emerges from extracting **topological invariants** from the neighbourhood structure induced by interactions between internal state and incoming signals.

Formally:

**Perception ≡ Topology(𝒩(X, I))**

where:
- **X**: internal system state
- **I**: incoming sensory/informational input
- **𝒩(X, I)**: induced neighbourhood relation (e.g., attention graphs, embedding proximity, receptive fields)
- **Topology(·)**: operator extracting invariants (persistent homology, graph invariants, manifold learning, etc.)

Perception is **shape, not signal** — **structure, not semantics** — **invariants, not appearances**.

## Formal Statement

Let X be the internal state of an intelligent system and I the incoming signal. The neighbourhood 𝒩(X, I) is defined by their interaction (e.g., cosine similarity in embedding space, temporal adjacency, tactile proximity).

The core claim:

**Perception = Topology(𝒩(X, I))**

This is substrate-independent and modality-agnostic — perception is a structural primitive, not tied to biology or specific sensors.

## Key Predictions

1. **Modality Equivalence**  
   Vision, hearing, touch, proprioception, etc., are implementations of the same topological computation. Differences are in input physics, not core mathematics.

2. **Cross-Modal Plasticity**  
   Sensory substitution (e.g., "seeing" via touch), remapping after injury, and phantom limbs occur naturally because topological structure persists across channels.

3. **Substrate Independence**  
   Any system defining neighbourhoods + extracting invariants can perceive — supports AGI, robotics, swarm systems, language models.

4. **Robustness to Loss**  
   Loss of input channel → reconfiguration, not elimination (e.g., spatial maps in blindness, rhythm in deafness).

5. **Code Implementability**  
   Fully realizable in software (transformers, GNNs + persistent homology / UMAP / diffusion models).

## Falsifiable Experimental Predictions

| # | Prediction | Test Method | Expected Outcome if True |
|---|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Same topology across 3 channels → same percept | Train multimodal model with isomorphic neighbourhoods | Convergent behavioural reports / embeddings |
| 2 | Divergent raw input, isomorphic topology → convergent percept | Compare scrambled vs. structured inputs | Perception aligns with topology, ignores raw differences |
| 3 | Distort signal but preserve topology → stable perception | Add noise / filtering that keeps relations | Percept unchanged |
| 4 | Destroy topology (scramble neighbourhoods) → collapse | Randomize connections despite intact signals | Perception fails dramatically |
| 5 | Topology-first systems → hallucination resistance | Compare to semantic baselines in AGI / robotics | Fewer hallucinations under uncertainty |

## Implications & Applications

- Unified theory bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, robotics, AGI.
- Robust sensory substitution devices.
- Hallucination-resistant AI perception stacks.
- Topological diagnostics for perceptual disorders.
- New priors for multimodal learning in transformers.
